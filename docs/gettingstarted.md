Open Platform for Rapid Development of Volunteer Management Systems

> NOTE: Documentation is still in progress

## Motivation

OpenVolunteerPlatform lets you automate and optimize work of volunteers for your 
orgranization or charity - helping them to deliver help when needed.

Platform gives organization flexibility by giving them ready to use reference implementation 
containing volunteer and admin applications along with tools to organize and scheduler their work. 

Platform provides simplicity of customizing reference implementation for your own use cases thanks
to autogenerated ad secure backend and client side components that are wrapping your data. 

## Reference deployment

Project provides reference admin and Volunteer application that can be used as it is to help on national or regional scale.
The project helps to connect people in need, often isolated at home with volunteers, 
by keeping these members out of danger and will alleviate the pressure on our public services and infrastructure, 
and other services that are trying to provide essentials such as groceries and medicines while keeping people safe. 
By empowering our communities to collaborate through software our volunteers can easily organize the collection and delivery of goods while social distancing.
